# CV-Basil-Good

This is my CV which contains my personal and professional information, including my education, work experience and skills. Inside this CV you find all information about me and also two Photography Websites I designed.

You also find those following folders:

CV:
  /CSS --> style.css wich contains all the styles for my CV
  
  /img --> image I used for the CV
  
  

Goodshots_Frontpage:
  /CSS --> style.css wich contains all the styles for the Goodshots Frontpage
  /img --> images I used for this site
  /main.html --> Direct path to this Website
  /scipt.js --> I also integrated some javascript to this website
  
  Goodshots_Fullpage:
  /CSS --> style.css wich contains all the styles for the Goodshots Fullpage
  /img --> images I used for this site
  /main.html --> Direct path to this Website wich contains a functional navigation bar. This navigation bar 
  leads you also to the following two files:
    -- artwork.html
    -- about_me.html
 

Feel free to check out the code I structured for these three websites.
